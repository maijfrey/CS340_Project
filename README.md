# CS340_Project

## Introduction
Welcome to Mai Frey and Ayra Sears' CS340 Project 'Movie Information Database'. This program allows users to 
manage the information and relationships between Movies, Actors, Directors, and Genres. The program has the 
capacity to add, update, and delete from the above mentioned categories along with a search capability.

Note: Citations can also be found in the code itself 

All code and modules are based on/adapted from the CS 340 starter code with the exception of portions of M:N updates. 

Styling via bootstraps was adapted from the boostraps website, specifically styling of forms and navbars. Other bootstrap stylings came from our personal previous knowledge (buttons, grid systems, paddings, margins).
